# ioBroker HomeMatic ReGaHSS Adapter

Connects HomeMatic CCU "Logic Layer" ("ReGaHSS") to ioBroker

## Purpose

This Adapter can keep HomeMatic-CCU-Variables in sync with ioBroker and offers the possibility to start
HomeMatic-CCU-Programs from ioBroker. Furthermore this adapter can be seen as a migration-helper, you can sync
device/channel-names, rooms, functions and favorites from the CCU to ioBroker (this is one way only, changes on ioBroker
side will be overwritten when synced again - so deactivate this features after the first sync).

## Install

This adapter needs one (ore more) already installed and initialized hm-rpc adapter to work.
